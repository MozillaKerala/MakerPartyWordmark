MakerPartyWordmark
==================

<p>Maker Party is Mozilla's global campaign to teach the web, with help from thousands of volunteers and community-run events around the world. Maker Party unites educators, organizations and enthusiastic web users with hands-on learning and making. More Information on <a href="https://party.webmaker.org/">Maker Party</a></p>

<p> Maker Party is a Campaign that is all about making, after organizing few maker parties and getting thrilled with makes generated during the event, I thought of making something on my own. CSS has been my favorite web scripting so I planned on to go ahead with some CSS mix-ups. I choose to remake the <a href="https://party.webmaker.org/en-US/resources">Maker Party resources</a> (logo and word mark), because I didn't find one.</p>

<p>It has been an year since since I used the extreme features in CSS to make logo's or shapes, my previous experiments with CSS :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://techstream.org/Web-Design/Dexter-with-CSS3">Dexter with CSS3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techstream.org/Web-Design/London-Olympics-2012-Logo-with-CSS3"> London Olympics logo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To make it easier to understand the CSS styles are arranged into different files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>shapes.css</code> contains the CSS that make the hexagonal shapes</li>
<li><code>letters.css</code> contains the CSS that makes the Maker Party Word-mark</li>
</ul>
